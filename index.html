         <p>The Indigenous Peoples of Canada have a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years. The Indigenous Peoples of Canada are made up of <em>many</em> different groups, each with their own unique culture, language, and traditions.</p>

         <p>The earliest evidence of human habitation in Canada dates back to around 12,000 BCE. Indigenous Peoples of Canada were the first inhabitants of the land, and their cultures and societies thrived for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European explorers.</p>
         
         <p>In the 16th century, European explorers began to arrive in Canada, and over the next few centuries, the land was colonized by the French and British. These colonizers brought with them disease, warfare, and other forms of violence that had devastating effects on Indigenous communities.</p>

         <p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the Canadian government implemented policies and practices aimed at assimilating Indigenous Peoples of Canada into Canadian society. These policies included the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families and communities to attend residential schools, where they were stripped of their culture, language, and traditions. The Indian Act of 1876 also imposed strict controls on Indigenous Peoples of Canada, including restricting their ability to own land or participate in political processes.</p>

         <p>In recent years, there has been a growing movement to recognize and address the injustices faced by Indigenous Peoples of Canada, including land rights, access to education and healthcare, and cultural preservation. Many Indigenous Peoples of Canada continue to work towards healing and reconciliation with the broader Canadian society, while also seeking to preserve and revitalize their unique cultures and languages.</p>

         <h2>Indigenous Tribes</h2>
         <p>Canada is home to a rich and diverse array of Indigenous peoples, including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. Each group has its own unique culture, traditions, and history.</p>
         <h3>First Nations</h3>
         <p>The <b>First Nations</b> peoples of Canada are the <em>largest</em> Indigenous group, with more than 900,000 individuals belonging to over 630 distinct nations. Some of the largest First Nations communities include the Cree, the Ojibwe, the Innu, the Haida, and the Mi'kmaq.</p>
         <h3>Inuit</h3>
         <p>The <b>Inuit</b> are Indigenous peoples who live in the Arctic regions of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, and Russia. In Canada, there are about 60,000 Inuit, who live in four regions: Nunavut, Nunavik (in Quebec), Nunatsiavut (in Labrador), and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (in the Northwest Territories).</p>
         <h3>Métis</h3>
         <p>The <b>Métis</b> are Indigenous peoples of mixed European and Indigenous ancestry. They have their own unique culture and history, which developed in the 18th and 19th centuries in the Canadian Prairies and the Great Lakes region. Today, there are more than 600,000 Métis people in Canada.</p>
         <figcaption>It's important to note that Indigenous peoples in Canada have a long history of facing discrimination and marginalization. As a result, there have been ongoing efforts to promote reconciliation and address historical injustices, including the residential school system, which forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and communities.</figcaption>
